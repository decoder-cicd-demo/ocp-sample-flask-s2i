# Flask Application deployed to OpenShift using S2I 

This repository provides a sample Python web application implemented using the Flask web framework and hosted using ``gunicorn``. It is intended to be used to demonstrate deployment of Python web applications to OpenShift 4 using [source-to-image](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/s2i.html#creating-images-s2i).

This is derived from [Sample Python Flask application for testing OpenShift 3 - by Graham Dumpleton](https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-python).


## Implementation Notes

This sample Python application relies on the support provided by the default S2I builder for deploying a WSGI application using the ``gunicorn`` WSGI server. The requirements which need to be satisfied for this to work are:

* The WSGI application code file needs to be named ``wsgi.py``.
* The WSGI application entry point within the code file needs to be named ``application``.
* The ``gunicorn`` package must be listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file for ``pip``.

The ``.s2i/environment`` file was created to allow environment variables to override the behaviour of the default S2I builder for Python.

* The environment variable ``APP_CONFIG=config.py``  declares the name of the ``gunicorn`` config file;

The example is based on [Getting Started with Flask](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework) but has 
been modified to work [Green Unicorn - WSGI sever](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/) and the content of the web-site 
changed to provide some [Lorem Ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) pages from [Lorem IPsum Generators - The 14 Best](https://digital.com/lorem-ipsum-generators/), 
and `isalive` and `isready` probe pages have been added for Kubernetes.

Key files:

* config.py: GUNICORN settings;
* wsgi.py: define the pages (routes) that are visible;
* templates/base.html: boiler-plate for html pages;
* templates/index.html: Standard Lorem Ipsum;
* templates/legal.html: Legal-style Lorem Ipsum;
* templates/pirate.html: Pirate-style Lorem Ipsum;
* templates/zombie.html: Zombie-style Lorem Ipsum

## Deployment Steps

The deployment was tested using *Red Hat CodeReady Containers* (CRC) details of which can be found here:

* [Introducing Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/);
* [Red Hat OpenShift 4 on your laptop: Introducing Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/09/05/red-hat-openshift-4-on-your-laptop-introducing-red-hat-codeready-containers/);
* [Red Hat CodeReady Containers / Install OpenShift on your laptop](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview);

To obtain the default CRC ``kubeadmin`` password, run ``crc console --credentials``.

```bash
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password> https://api.crc.testing:6443
$ oc whoami               # kubeadmin
$ oc new-project work00   # create work00 OCP project
$ oc project              # check project is work00

$ oc expose service/ocp-sample-flask-s2i  # make accessible outside OCP.

Once the application deployment is finished then it will be accessible as [ocp-sample-flask-s2i](http://ocp-sample-flask-s2i-work00.apps-crc.testing).

```bash
$ oc get all | egrep "HOST/PORT|route.route" # HOST/PORT column provides the URL

From the OpenShift Console WebUI:

* From *Builds* check the build log file, to see what is happening
* From *Services* link, you can access the Pod, and even open a terminal on the Pod.


## Undeployment Steps

```bash
$ oc get all --selector app=ocp-sample-flask-s2i     # list everything associated with the app
$ oc delete all --selector app=ocp-sample-flask-s2i  # delete everything associated with the app
$ oc delete project work00                           # delete the work00 project
```

    Python 3.8 
    ---------- 
    Python 3.8 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Python 3.8 applications and frameworks. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
